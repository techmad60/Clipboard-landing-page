## Overview
A really nice challenge, really questioned my layout abilities, but I pulled through

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I really learnt a lot about how to organize my html.


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```<li>
      <a href="#">
        <abbr title="Frequently asked questions">FAQs</abbr>
      </a>
    </li>
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  //Yeah, I just started using css reset :D.
  * {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: inherit;
}
}
```

### Continued development
Learning to code is a never ending journey, I will keep learning anythin I can that will increase my value.
